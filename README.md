# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The school board believes reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. I have been requested to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. After replacing the math and reading scores,I repeated the school district analysis initially completed in this module and wrote a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
